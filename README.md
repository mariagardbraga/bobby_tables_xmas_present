# Advent of Code 2015 -  Day 7: Some Assembly Required

This is a proposed solution for the problem of day 7 - some assembly required.

I solved it using a recursive method which has two edge cases: whether the value of a certain wire has already been
discovered or the wire operation is an integer assignment.

The tests on the tests folder helped solving the problem. One is the little one presented in the problem statement 
and another one is created by me, because the first one was not representative of all the possible operations of the 
problem.

To run execute

```
python main.py input_puzzle.txt
```

and enter the wire desired on the prompt.
